plinkio
=======

Python library for reading
[PLINK binary files](http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/data.shtml)
(BED/BIM/FAM)

At the time this Python library was started, we were unable to find
alternatives such as [libplinkio](https://github.com/fadern/libplinkio),
and the scope of the library was broader than PLINK I/O routines. Now
that the scope of this library has been shrinked to reading PLINK files
and that alternative Python libraries have appeared, it might make sense
to re-use/merge such Python libraries.
